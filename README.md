## GrAph Theory TOols

This a package written in Go to handle graphs.   Its primary objective is to easily perform exhaustive searches within the space of all graphs of a certain order.

This project is currently a work in progress.   In a first instance, we will focus on developing static graphs (graphs that cannot be modified).
